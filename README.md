# UFOs

## Overview 

The goal of this project is to create a site that allows users to interact with the UFO data dynamically based on different input categories. The data was collected by Dana a data journalist who has been collecting and researching on this subject since the 1950s. 

This HTML site used javascript and bootstrap as the main components for formatting and dynamic interaction.

## Summary 

The goal of this is to give user an overall idea of the data. The following can be done to help users explore the data further:

- trend analysis based on the filters 
- a reset button so users don't have to manually update filters 
- graphs to help visualize the data
